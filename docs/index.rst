People who want to start investing without having to know a lot about money have turned to Acorns.  The main idea is simple: collect extra change from your everyday transactions and invest it automatically.  It's important to know how to login in to your Acorn account, whether you're new to the program or have been using it for years.  This makes it easy for you to get to your money, see updates on your investments, and use all of Acorns' capabilities.

 When you check in to your Acorn account, you get to your own investment space.  It links you to tools like Round-Ups, Recurring Investments, retirement planning, and educational resources that can help you build your wealth.  The process of signing in is meant to be quick, safe, and available on any device.

 How can I access my Acorn account?

 First, go to the official Acorns website or use the Acorns app on your phone.  The choice to sign in will be quite evident.  If you tap or click it, you'll be asked to enter your email address and password.  These details should be the same as the ones you used to make your Acorn account.  If you enter the information correctly, you'll be taken to your dashboard.

 Acorns may send a verification number to your phone or email to authenticate your identity, depending on how secure your account is.  This is a normal two-step authentication process that keeps those who shouldn't have access to your financial information from getting it.  After your identity has been confirmed, you may see your investments, keep track of your financial growth, and make changes as needed.

 Can't Get Into Your Acorn Account?

 It's typical to forget a password or have problems signing in from time to time, especially if you haven't used the site in a while.  If you're having trouble signing in to your Acorn account, the first thing you should do is make sure you typed your email and password correctly.  You probably don't think about it, but typos happen a lot.

 If the problem keeps happening, click the "Forgot Password?" link below the sign-in forms.  You will need to type in the email address you used to sign up.  Acorns will provide you a safe link so you can change your password.  Make sure to read the instructions carefully and choose a strong password that you haven't used before.  This not only helps you get back in, but it also makes your account safer.

 Why You Should Keep Your Acorn Sign In Information Safe

 Your Acorn account holds private information, such as your bank account and investment information.  That's why it's so important to keep your login information secret.  Don't reveal your login details, and don't log into your account on public or shared devices.

 A password manager can help you make a strong password and keep it safe.  Also, make sure you're always logging in using the official Acorns app or website to avoid bogus login sites and phishing scams.  Scammers might make fake sites that appear like real ones to steal your information.  If you're not sure, type the URL straight into your browser instead than clicking on links in emails or messages.

 It's safe to sign in on more than one device as long as you are careful.  Don't save passwords on public computers, and always log out after checking your account on a computer that other people can use.  Acorns may ask you to confirm your identity before letting you in if it sees a sign-in from a device or location that it doesn't recognize.
